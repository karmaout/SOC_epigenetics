# SOC Multiome Analysis

This repository contains analysis code for single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq
from BLA and PC during second-order conditioning.

## Data
- 10x Genomics Multiome
- Regions: BLA, PC
- Conditions: U_E, P_E, U_R, P_R

## Pipeline
1. Subset VGLUT1 neurons
2. Identify Fos⁺ cells
3. Run WNN integration
4. Compute FRiP (cell-level and pseudo-bulk)
